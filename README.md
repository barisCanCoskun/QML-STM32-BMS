# QML-STM32-BMS
Getting BMS data with STM32 and showing to user with QML application  
  
In this QML project, I'm getting BMS data from STM32 and showing it on the QML application.  
Whenever the user pushes the button on the QML app, the Qt side writes related data to the serialport.  
On the STM32 side, when data received, it transmits related data to serialport.  
Used STM32L476, Qt6, and Ubuntu 22.  

I wrote manual BMS data because the purpose of this project showing communication of Stm32 and QML app.
  
This video is slow because my computer is very old, sorry about that.
